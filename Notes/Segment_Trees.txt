Segment trees
-------------
    # A segment-tree is a data strucuture that is a tree and used to solve range query problems.
    # Segment trees are used in problems where there multiple range queries and modification of elements of the same array.
    # The leaf nodes of the segment tree are the elements of array we need to perform range query
    # Time-complexity 
        - Query = O(logN)
        - Update = O(logN)
    # Space-complexity - O(N)
