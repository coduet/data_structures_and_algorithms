Sorting
-------

1. Merge Sort
-------------
	- A divide and conquer approach to sort arrays.
	- It divides the array into two halves and then merges the two halves after they are sorted.
	- Time complexity = θ(nlogn)
	- Space complexity = O(n)
	- Applications - Inversion Count Problem	

2. Quick Sort 
-------------
	- Applies divide and conquer paradigm to sort arrays
	- Approach quicj=k
		# Partition array into 2 arrays 
		# Sort two arrays
		# Combine two arrays
	- Avergage time = θ(nlogn), Worst =  θ(n^2)
	- Space = O(1)

3. Heap Sort
------------

4. Insertion Sort
